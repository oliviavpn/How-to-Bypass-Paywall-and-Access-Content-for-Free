## Methods to Bypass Paywalls

### 1. Use Incognito or Private Browsing Mode
Many paywalls use cookies to track how many free articles you’ve read. By switching to **incognito mode**, you avoid cookie storage and reset that limit every time.

### 2. Clear Your Browser Cookies
If you’ve reached your article limit, **clearing cookies** can trick the website into thinking you’re a new visitor. Most browsers let you do this with just a few clicks.

### 3. Search for Read-Only Versions
Often, searching the article title on Google along with **"read free"** or "archive" can bring up versions without the paywall. These can be cached copies or alternative publication sources.

### 4. Use Browser Extensions
Extensions like **“Bypass Paywalls”**, **“Reader Mode”**, or **“Outline”** allow you to extract and read articles without triggering paywall barriers.

### 5. Use a Proxy or VPN
Some paywalls and content restrictions are based on **location**. By using a **proxy or VPN**, you can change your virtual region and **unlock content reserved for other countries**.
